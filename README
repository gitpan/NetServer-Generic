README for NetServer::Generic


NetServer::Generic is a perl module that implements an object-oriented
interface for developing internet servers.

It requires:

* Perl 5.004 or later
* The following modules:
  -- IO::Socket (part of the standard distribution, or available from
     CPAN)
  -- ChatBot::Eliza (optional: used by the elizad example)

Two examples are included:

  elizad -- a simple psychotherapy daemon
  shttpd -- a really, stupidly, basic HTTP server

(A future example including an SMTP daemon is planned)

To install NetServer::Generic, follow the usual Perl module installation
practice, viz (probably as root):

  cd Generic
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
