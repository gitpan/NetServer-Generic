=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<NetServer::Generic> provides a (very) simple server daemon for TCP/IP
processes. It is intended to free the programmer from having to think
too hard about networking issues so that they can concentrate on 
doing something useful.

The C<NetServer::Generic> object accepts the following methods, which 
configure various aspects of the new server:

=over 4

=item port

The port to listen on.

=item hostname

The local address to bind to. If no address is specified, listens for
any connection on the designated port.

=item listen

Queue size for listen.

=item proto

Protocol we're listening to (defaults to tcp)

=item timeout

Timeout value (see L<IO::Socket::INET>)

=item allowed

list of IP addresses or hostnames that are explicitly allowed to connect
to the server. If empty, the default policy is to allow connections from
anyone not in the 'forbidden' list.

NOTE: IP addresses or hostnames may be specified as perl regular
expressions; for example 154\.153\.4\..* matches any IP address
beginning with '154.153.4.';
.*antipope\.org matches any hostname in the antipope.org domain.

=item forbidden

list of IP addresses or hostnames that are refused permission to
connect to the server. If empty, the default policy is to refuse
connections from anyone not in the 'allowed' list (unless the
allowed list is empty, in which case anyone may connect).

=item callback

Coderef to a subroutine which handles incoming connections (called
with one parameter -- a C<NetServer::Generic> object which can be used 
to shut down the session).

=item mode

Can be one of B<forking>, B<select>, B<select_fast>, B<client>, 
B<threaded>, or B<prefork>.

By default, B<forking> mode is selected.

B<forking> mode is selected, the server handles requests by forking a
child process to service them. If B<select> mode is selected, the server
uses the C<IO::Select> class to implement a simple non-forking server.

The select-based server may block on i/o on a heavily-loaded system. If
you need to do non-blocking i/o you should look at NetServer::FastSelect.

The B<client> mode is special; it indicates that rather than sitting
around waiting for an incoming connection, the server is itself a
TCP/IP client. In client mode, C<hostname> is the B<remote> host to
connect to and C<port> is the remote port to open. The callback
routine is used, as elsewhere, but it should be written as for a
client -- i.e. it should issue a request or command, then read.
An additional method exists for client mode: C<trigger>. C<trigger>
expects a coderef as a parameter. This coderef is executed
before the client-mode server spawns a child; if it returns a non-zero
value the child is forked and opens a client connection to the target
host, otherwise the server exits. The trigger method may be used to
sleep for a random interval then return 1 (so that repeated clients
are spawned at random intervals), or fork several children (on a one-
time-only basis) then work as above (so that several clients poke at
the target server on a random basis). The default trigger method 
returns 1 immediately the first time it is called, then returns 0 --
this means that the client makes a single connection to the target
host, invokes the callback routine, then exits. (See the test examples
which come with this module for examples of how to use client mode.) 

Note that client mode relies on the fork() system call.

The B<threaded> mode indicates that multithreading will be used to
service requests. This feature requires Perl 5.005 or higher and a
native threads library to run, so it's not 100% portable). Moreover,
it's unreliable! Don't use this mode unless you're prepared to do some
debugging.

The B<prefork> mode indicates that the server will bind to the
designated port, then fork repeatedly up to C<$start_servers> times
(where C<start_servers> is a scalar parameter to C<NetServer::Generic>).
Each child then enters a select-based loop. (i.e. run_select), but exits
after handling C<$server_lifespan> transactions (where C<server_lifespan>
is another parameter to C<NetServer::Generic>).  Every time a child
handles a transaction it writes its PID and generation number down a pipe
to the parent process, with a message when it exits.  The parent keeps
track of how many servers are in use and fires up extra children (up to
C<$max_servers>) if the number in use leaves less than C<$min_spare_servers>
free. See the example B<preforked-shttpd> for a minimal HTTP 0.9 server
implemented using the B<prefork> mode.


=back

Of these, the C<callback> method is most important; it specifies
a reference to a subroutine which effectively does whatever the
server does.

A callback subroutine is a normal Perl subroutine. It is invoked
with STDIN and STDOUT attached to an C<IO::Socket::INET> object,
so that reads from STDIN get information from the client, and writes
to STDOUT send information to the client. Note that both STDIN and
STDOUT are unbuffered. In addition, a C<NetServer::Generic> object is 
passed as an argument (but the C<callback> is free to ignore it).

Your server reads and writes data via the socket as if it is the
standard input and standard output filehandles; for example:

  while (defined ($tmp = <STDIN>)) {  # read a line from the socket

  print STDOUT "You said: $tmp\n";    # print something to the socket

(See C<IO::Handle> and C<IO::Socket> for more information on this.)

If you're not familiar with sockets, don't get too fresh and try to 
close or seek on STDIN or STDOUT; just treat them like a file.

The server object is not strictly necessary in the callback, but comes
in handy: you can shut down the server completely by calling the 
C<quit()> method.
 
When writing a callback subroutine, remember to define some condition under 
which you return! 

Here's a slightly more complex server example:


 # minimal http server (HTTP/0.9):
 # this is a REALLY minimal HTTP server. It only understands GET
 # requests, does no header parsing whatsoever, and doesn't understand
 # relative addresses! Nor does it understand CGI scripts. And it ain't
 # suitable as a replacement for Apache (at least, not any time soon :).
 # The base directory for the server and the default
 # file name are defined in B<url_to_file()>, which maps URLs to
 # absolute pathnames. The server code itself is defined in the
 # closure B<$http>, which shows how simple it is to write a server
 # using this module.

 sub url_to_file($) {
   # for a given URL, turn it into an absolute pathname
   my ($u) = shift ;  # incoming URL fragment from GET request
   my ($f) = "";      # file pathname to return
   my ($htbase) = "/usr/local/etc/httpd/docs/";
   my ($htdefault) = "index.html";
   chop $u;
   if ($u eq "/") {
       $f = $htbase . $htdefault;
       return $f;
   } else {
       if ($u =~ m|^/.+|) {
           $f = $htbase;  chop $f;
           $f .= $u;
       } elsif ($u =~ m|[^/]+|) {
           $f = $htbase . $u;
       }
       if ($u =~ m|.+/$|) {
           $f .= $htdefault;
       }
       if ($f =~ /\.\./) {
           my (@path) = split("/", $f);
           my ($buff, $acc) = "";
           shift @path;
           while ($buff = shift @path) {
               my ($tmp) = shift @path;
               if ($tmp ne '..') {
                   unshift @path, $tmp;
                   $acc .= "/$buff";
               }
           }
           $f = $acc;
       }
   }
   return $f;
 }

 my ($http) = sub {
    my ($fh) = shift ;
    while (defined ($tmp = <STDIN>)) {
        chomp $tmp;
        if ($tmp =~ /^GET\s+(.*)$/i) {
            $getfile = $1;
            $getfile = url_to_file($getfile);
            print STDERR "Sending $getfile\n";
            my ($in) = new IO::File();
            if ($in->open("<$getfile") ) {
                $in->autoflush(1);
                print STDOUT "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
                while (defined ($line = <$in>)) {
                    print STDOUT $line;
                }
            } else {
                print STDOUT "404: File not found\n\n";
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
 };                           

 # main program starts here

 my (%config) =  ("port"     => 9000, 
                  "callback" => $http, 
                  "hostname" => "public.antipope.org");

 my ($allowed) = ['.*antipope\.org', 
                  '.*localhost.*'];

 my ($forbidden) = [ '194\.205\.10\.2'];

 my ($foo) = new Server(%config); # create new http server bound to port 
                                  # 9000 of public.antipope.org
 $foo->allowed($allowed);         # who is allowed to connect to us
 $foo->forbidden($forbidden);     # who is refused access
 print "Starting http server on port 9000\n";
 $foo->run();                     
 exit 0;


=head2 Additional methods

C<NetServer::Generic> provides a couple of extra methods.

=over 4

=item peer()

The B<peer()> method returns a reference to a two-element list containing 
the hostname and IP address of the host at the other end of the socket.
If called before a connection has been received, its value will be undefined.
(Don't try to assign values via B<peer> unless you want to confuse the 
allowed/forbidden checking code!)

=item quit()

The B<quit()> method attempts to shut down a server. If running as a forking
service, it does so by sending a kill -15 to the parent process. If running
as a select-based service it returns from B<run()>.

=item start_servers()

In B<prefork> mode, specifies how many child servers to start up.

=item max_servers()

In B<prefork> mode, specifies the maximum number of children to spawn
under load.

=item min_spare_servers()

In B<prefork> mode, specifies a number of spare (inactive) child
servers; if we drop below this level (due to load), the parent will spawn
additional children (up to a maximum of B<max_servers>) until we go back
over B<min_spare_servers>.

=item server_lifespan()

In B<prefork> server mode, child servers run as select servers. After
B<server_lifespan> connections they will commit suicide and be replaced by
the parent. If B<server_lifespan> is set to 1, children will effectively
run once then exit (like a forking server). For purposes of insanity,
a lifespan of 0 is treated like a lifespan of 1.

=item servername()

In the B<prefork> server, unless you I<explicitly> tell the server to bind
to a named host, it will accept all incoming connections. Within a client, 
you may need to know what local IP address an incoming connection was 
intended for. The C<servername()> method can be invoked within the child
server's callback and returns a two-element arrayref containing the port
and IP address that the connection came in on. For example, in the client:

  my $callback = sub {
    my $server = shift;
    my ($server_port, $server_addr) = @{ $server->servername() };
    print "Connection on $server_addr:$server_port\n";

=head2 Types of server

A full discussion of internet servers is well beyond the scope of this man
page. Beginners may want to start with a source like L<Beginning Linux 
Programming> (which provides a simple, lucid discussion); more advanced
readers may find Stevens' L<Advanced Programming in the UNIX environment>
useful.

In general, on non-threaded systems, a forking server is slightly less
efficient than a select-based server (and uses up lots of PIDs). On the other
hand, a select-based server is not a good solution to high workloads or
time-consuming processes such as providing an NNTP news feed to an online
newsreader.

A major issue with the select-based server code in this release is that
the IO::Select based server cannot know that a socket is ready until some 
data is received over it. (It calls B<can_read()> to detect sockets waiting
to be read from.) Thus, it is not suitable for writing servers like
which emit status information without first reading a request.

=head1 BUGS

There are two bugs lurking in NetServer::Generic. Or maybe they're 
design flaws. I don't have time to fix them right now, but maybe
you'd like to contribute an hour or two and get your name in the
credits?

Bug the first:

NetServer::Generic attempts to make it easy to write a server by letting
the programmer concentrate on reading from STDIN and writing to STDOUT.
However, this form of i/o is line oriented.  NetServer::Generic relies
on the buffering and i/o capabilities provided by Perl and IO::Socket
respectively. It doesn't buffer its own input.

This means that in principle a malicious attacker (or just a badly-
written client program) can write a stream of bytes to a
NetServer::Generic application and, as long as those bytes don't
include a "\n", Perl will keep gobbling it up until it runs out of
virtual memory.

This can be fixed by replacing the globbed IO::Socket::INET that is
attached to STDIN with something else -- probably an object that presents
itself as an IO::Stringy but that does its own buffering, so that it
will return I<either> a line, or some sort of error message in $! if
it sees something undigestible in its input stream. (If anyone wants
to contribute a patch that fixes this, please feel free; this is an open
source project, after all ...)

Bug the second:

The select-based server was originally written because I wanted to
share state information between some forking servers and I couldn't
use System V shared memory (the application had to be portable to a 
flavour of UNIX that didn't support it). 

It works okay, up to a point, but under heavy load on Linux it can run
into major problems. Partly this may be attributable to deficiencies
in the way Linux handles the select() system call (or so Stephen
Tweedie keeps telling me), but the result is that the select-based
server tends to drop some connections when it's under stress: if 
two connections come in while it's serving another, the first may
never get processed before a timeout occurs.

A somewhat worse problem is that IO::Select doesn't do buffered (line-
oriented) input; it just checks to see if one or more bytes are
waiting to be read from one of the file handles it's got hold of. It
is possible for a couple of bytes to come in (but not a whole line),
so that the select-based server merrily tries to process a transaction
and blocks until the rest of the input arrives -- thus ensuring that
the server is bottlenecked by the speed of the slowest client connection.

Suggestion: if you need to serve lots of connections using select(),
look at the eventserver module instead. If you're a bit more
ambitious, the defect in NetServer::Generic is fixable by writing a
module with a similar API to IO::Select, but which provides buffering
for the file handles under its control and which only returns
something in response to can_read() when one of the buffers has a 
complete line of input waiting.
